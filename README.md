# ETH-Calc
Cryptocurrency calculator

link: https://ethcalculator.netlify.com/

This web app calculates the exact amount of eth to be sent when you enter amount in $. It takes the current ETH price from API and adds a fee of 0.005 ETH to the price because I use Kraken.com for sending cryptocurrencies. Example: I want to send $50 in ETH, I get a prompt from the app to enter an amount in $, after that, I get exact amount to be sent including copy button.
