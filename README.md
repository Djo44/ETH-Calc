# ETH-Calc
Cryptocurrency calculator


This web app calculate exact ammount of eth to be sent when you enter ammount in $.
It takes current ETH price from API
It adds fee of 0.005 ETH to the price because i use Kraken.com for sending cryptocurrencies.
Example: I want to send $50 in ETH, i get prompt from app to enter ammount, after that i get exact amount to be sent including copy button.
